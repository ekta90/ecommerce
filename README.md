Step 1: Create a GitHub account
The easiest way to get started is to create an account on GitHub.com (it's free)
Pick a username (e.g.,ekta90), enter your email address and a password, and click Sign up for GitHub.
Step 2: Create a new repository
A repository is like a place or a container where something is stored; in this case we're creating a Git repository to store code. To create a new repository, select New Repository from the + sign dropdown menu .
 Step 3: Enter a name for your repository (e.g, "ecommerce") and click Create Repository. Now your repository is created( write inst which you want to share with others).
 Add the file to the new local repository.
step 4 
     Use "git add ". in your bash to add all the files to the given folder.
step 5
      Use "git status" in your bash to view all the files which are going to be staged to the first commit.
step 6 Commit the files staged in your local repository by writing a commit message.
     
      * ( git commit uses '-m' "your msg without colon" )as a flag for a message to set the commits
step 7 
  7. Copy your remote repository's URL from GitHub.
step 8 
     Add the URL copied, which is your remote repository to where your local content from your repository is pushed.
       * (git remote add origin 'your_url_name')
step 9. Push the code in your local repository to GitHub
        * ( git push -u origin master ) is used for pushing local content to GitHub.
        enter your password and if for github.
